Lab:  Modern  Art  UI
---------------------

Objectives
==========

Create an application from scratch with an interesting user interface using what you learned in the User Interface Classes Lesson.

Explanation
===========

This application's user interface is composed of geometric shapes arranged in a particular order. Its layout inspired by the works of Modern Art masters such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson.

This application's user interface has one area containing multiple colored rectangles and another containing a SeekBar (sometimes called a Slider). When the user drags the SeekBar, all non-white / non-grey rectangles gradually change their color.

This application also contains an Options Menu. When the user clicks on the options menu an option labeled, "More Information" should appear.

When the user clicks on the "More Information" option, a Dialog should appear displaying some text and displaying two Buttons.

If the user clicks on the "Not Now" Button in the Dialog, the Dialog should be dismissed. If the user clicks on the "Visit MOMA" Button, then the Web Browser should be opened to view a web page on the MoMA.org web site.
